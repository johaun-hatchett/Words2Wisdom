# Text2KG

Using large language models (ChatGPT) to automatically construct a knowledge graph from unstructured plain text.

## Usage

### Gradio app

#### Remotely

Visit the [Text2KG HuggingFace Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/jhatchett/Text2KG).

#### Locally

Clone this repository, and then use the command

```
python main.py
```

in the repository's directory.

### Within a `python` IDE

Import the primary pipeline method using

```python
>>> from main import create_knowledge_graph
```

**`create_knowledge_graph` parameters**

```
api_key (str)
    OpenAI API key
ngram_size (int)
    Number of sentences per forward pass
axiomatize (bool)
    Whether to decompose sentences into simpler axioms as a
    pre-processing step. Doubles the amount of calls to ChatGPT
text (str)
    Input text to extract knowledge graph from
progress
    Progress bar. The default is Gradio's progress bar; 
    set `progress = tqdm` for implementations outside of Gradio
```
